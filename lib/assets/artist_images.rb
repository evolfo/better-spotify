Here in North America, he has played at many music festivals--including but not limited to: Hardly Strictly Bluegrass, SXSW, and Canadian Music Week. He currently resides in Brooklyn and performs regularly with Iris Lune, Cale Hawkins, Shubh Saran, and less regularly with many more.

Songwriter and producer. Gifted with an extraordinary voice and creator of a sound of her own."
